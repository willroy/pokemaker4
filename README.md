Ideas

Just display whole image and use click position relative to get quad x y
on click, save current selection in globals.data for canvas to use eventually
caluclate how many spritesheets is reasonable to fit side by side on bottom of editor, then show that many
scale up so that it fits to width of screen

Spritesheet bookmarks bind to keybind?

Add ui elements for text input and checkbox

alterable keybinds and settings in those menus
